How to use the WaitForPlayerAnswer function

To use the WaitForPlayerAnswer function you can either set a string value to it and put your question in it as an argument and refrence it:

String yourstring = WaitForPlayerAnswer("your question here")
if (yourstring == "the answer you want"){
    do what you want here
}

Or you can put it directly into the if statement:

if (WaitForPlayerAnswer("your question here") == "the answer you want"){
    do what you want here
}

A little example of what you can do:

Say("hi, welcome to my game. In this game you will have to pick options!");
WaitSeconds(2);
Say("your hero is Robin, he is going to school.");
string transport = WaitForPlayerAnswer("do you want to walk to school?");

if (transport == "yes")
{
    Say("Great, let's go!");
}
else{
    Say("i can't wait to talk to Ross, when i get on the bus.");
}
